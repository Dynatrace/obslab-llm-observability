## Using LLM-based Destination Search

Type the name of a destination (eg. `Vienna`) into the search bar and click the `Advise` button.

### What Happens Next?

- The application will request information for your destination from OpenAI using ChatGPT 4o mini.
- A result will be returned from OpenAI
- The result is cached in the weviate vector cache

If you search for `Vienna` again, this time, the re1sult will be served from the cache - saving you the roundtrip (time and $) to OpenAI / ChatGPT.
