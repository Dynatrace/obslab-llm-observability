## ðŸ†™ Time to Fire it up

Choose one of the following options to start the codespace:


### Launch Standard Version

[![Open "standard" version in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dynatrace-perfclinics/obslab-llm-observability?ref=main){target="_blank"}

### Launch RAG Version

[![Open "RAG" version in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dynatrace-perfclinics/obslab-llm-observability?ref=ollama-pinecone){target="_blank"}

Leave the top section blank and provide your values in the `Recommended secrets` form.

After the codespaces has started (in a new browser tab), the post creation script should begin. This will install everything and will take a few moments.

When the script has completed, a success message will briefly be displayed (it is so quick you'll probably miss it) and an empty terminal window will be shown.

You may now proceed.
