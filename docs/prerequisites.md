To run this demo you will need:

- A Dynatrace SaaS account ([free trial](https://dynatrace.com/trial){target="_blank"})
- An OpenAI account with credit added
- For the RAG version, a (free) PineCone account

## Why is a Paid OpenAI Account Required?

OpenAI / ChatGPT severely limits the ability for API access if you do not have credit. Adding a small amount of credit ($2-$3) is the best way to make this (and all other ChatGPT demos) run smoothly.

This demo uses [gpt 4o mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini){target="_blank"}. We have developed, tested and demoed this repository hundreds of times and still have money left from the initial $5 credit load.
